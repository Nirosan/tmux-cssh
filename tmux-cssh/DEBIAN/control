Description: TMUX with a "ClusterSSH"-like behaviour.
 tmux is a terminal multiplexer, like e.g. screen, which gives you a
 possibility to use multiple virtual terminal session within one real
 terminal session. tmux-cssh (tmux-cluster-ssh) sets a comfortable and
 easy to use functionality, clustering and synchronizing virtual tmux-sessions,
 on top of tmux. No need for a x-server or x-forwarding. tmux-cssh works
 just with tmux and in a low-level terminal-environment, like most server do.
